title: "Testing embedding Shiny"
format: 
  html:
    theme: cosmo
server: shiny

```{python}
from shiny import render, ui
from shiny.express import input
from shiny import App, render, ui
```

# This is an example of embedded Python/Shiny code

Here is some paragraph text.

So this doesn't work.

```{python}

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.panel_title("Hello Shiny!"),
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)
```

Here is some more text

```{python}
def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"
```

Further text

```{python}
app = App(app_ui, server)
```
